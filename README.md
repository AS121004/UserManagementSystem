This project demonstrates how to create a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express, MySQL & Express-Handlebars with functionalities such as user creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD operations).

Key Components of the Project:

Backend:

Node.js and Express.js: Serve as the foundation for the server-side application, handling HTTP requests and routing.
MySQL Database: Stores user data, including fields like name, email, and status.
Sequelize ORM: Manages database interactions, providing an abstraction layer over raw SQL queries.

Frontend:

Express-Handlebars: A templating engine that renders dynamic views, allowing the display of user data and forms for CRUD operations.
Bootstrap: Facilitates responsive design and enhances the user interface with pre-built components.
Functionalities Implemented:

Create User: Users can be added through a form, with data sent to the server and stored in the MySQL database.
Read Users: Displays a list of all users retrieved from the database.
Update User: Allows editing of user details, with changes reflected in the database.
Delete User: Enables the removal of users from the database.
Learning Outcomes:

Setting up a Node.js project with Express.js.
Configuring a MySQL database and integrating it with a Node.js application using Sequelize.
Implementing server-side rendering with Express-Handlebars.
Performing CRUD operations and handling HTTP requests.
Enhancing the frontend with Bootstrap for improved user experience.
This project serves as a foundational example for building more complex web applications using similar technologies.
